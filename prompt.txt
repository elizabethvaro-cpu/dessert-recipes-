1. App Overview

Build a native mobile application using Expo (React Native) that allows users to discover dessert recipes from around the world.
The app should fetch recipes from a public open recipe API, focusing on desserts by country or cuisine.

The app must work on:

📱 iOS

🤖 Android

🌐 Web (Expo Web, deployable on Vercel)

2. Functional Requirements

Use Expo (managed workflow)

Use React Native with TypeScript

Fetch data from a free, open recipe API

Support global dessert cuisines

Must be mobile-first

Must be Vercel-ready

No authentication required

Handle loading and error states gracefully

3. Core Features
🍰 Recipe Discovery

Short description (if available)

🔍 Filtering & Navigation

Filter desserts by:

Country / cuisine

Scrollable recipe list

Tap a recipe to view full details

📖 Recipe Detail Screen

Ingredients list

4. API Integration

Use TheMealDB (free & open):

Base URL:
https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/

Example Endpoints:

Desserts by category:
/filter.php?c=Dessert

Lookup recipe details:
/lookup.php?i={mealId}

Filter by area (country):
/filter.php?a={Area}

API Requirements:

Centralized API service file

Typed responses (TypeScript)

Async/await pattern

Graceful failure handling

5. App Architecture

app/ or src/ directory structure

Screens:

HomeScreen

RecipeListScreen

RecipeDetailScreen

Components:

RecipeCard

LoadingSpinner

Services:

api.ts (recipe API)

Navigation:

expo-router or @react-navigation/native

6. Styling & UI

Use StyleSheet API or NativeWind

Clean, modern, food-focused UI

Warm dessert-themed colors (cream, chocolate, pastel tones)

Responsive layouts

Consistent spacing and typography

7. Deployment Readiness

Ensure the app is:

Compatible with Expo Web

Configured for Vercel deployment

Includes:

app.json

Web output support

No native dependencies that break web builds

8. Output Expectations
The final output should include:

Fully working Expo app code

TypeScript usage throughout

Clear folder structure

Comments explaining key logic

API service abstraction

Instructions to:

Run locally with Expo

Build for web

Deploy to Vercel

9. Development Instructions

Use best practices

Avoid unnecessary dependencies

Prefer clarity over cleverness

Generate complete, runnable files

Assume this will be cloned and run immediately
